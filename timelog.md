## Week 8

*6 hours* Tyring to implement U-net Algorithm

## Week 9

13 November 
*3 Hours* Continuing to implement U-net Algorithm

14 Novemer

*45 mins* Meeting with Fani
*3 hours* Learning and continuing to implement U-net Algorithm
*5 Hours* Trying to implement and revise understanding of Deep Learning by using Obsidian software


15 November - 21 November
*40 hours* All in all this week has been dedicated for fully finalising and researching all the
necessary information for deep learning linked with the subjects. Convolutional, attention mechanisms and transformation
mechanisms have been studied. U-net basic has been implemented alongside pre-processing methods

22 Nov to 8th Dec

Other than 30 mins meeting with Fani, No work was done due to coursework and exam constraints

# General notes

- need to get rid of redundant training information in project
- need to understand how cs-unet works in its entirety, write down how to configure my thing to it

Beginning of January to 15th Jan

*20 Hours* Working on reconfiguring U-Net Model, started to plan Background, DL course background check

15th Jan - 22 Jan

*40 hours in total* More experimentation with the U-net model, managed to get an output that was ideal,
had to completely reimplement U-Net model as a result. Worked on backrgound of DL, backproagation

22 Jan

*6 hours* 
- Research methods for implementing segmentation of segmented values, attempted to get better BraTS data
- Started implementing new configuration system for application

22 Jan -> 5 Feb

*(per week) roughly 30-40 hours*
- Researching methods ot optimize the process of training a classifier
- experiment and troubleshooting with different parameters to understand why U-Net model is not working
- Problem was learning rate the whole time
- Will start to experiment with YAML over ini for configurations purposes
-
