# Brain Tumor Image Segmentation with Convolutional Transformer Deep Learning

Put a brief description of your code here. This should at least describe the file structure.

## Build instructions

**You must** include the instructions necessary to build and deploy this project successfully. If appropriate, also include 
instructions to run automated tests. 

### Requirements

* Python 3.11
* Packages: listed in `requirements.txt` 
* Tested on Windows 10

### Build steps

List the steps required to build software. 

Hopefully something simple like `pip install -e .` or `make` or `cd build; cmake ..`. In
some cases you may have much more involved setup required.

### Dataset Structure

### Execution

In order to use the experiment, one must configure the given requirements by using one of the supported configuration format files.
This pipeline supports YAML formats. In order to 


```cmd
python <experiment.py> resources/config.ini

```

There are four ways of interacting with the deep learning pipeline.

These experiment files exist as python files in the src//experiments folder.
